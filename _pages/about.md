I am a graduate student at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://ece.illinois.edu/)(UIUC). Before that, I received my B.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Lafayette College](https://ece.lafayette.edu/).
Currently, I am looking for a software engineer internship for Summer 2022. I worked as a software engineer intern at [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) in 2021.

- Software Engineer Intern @ Linux Foundation, Jun 2021- Aug 2021          
- Check out [Hyperledger's blog post](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2021/09/21/hyperledger-mentorship-spotlight-iroha-and-cactus-integration)
	- Designed and implemented a connector plugin with **Typescript**, **Node.js** and **Docker** to enable integration between Iroha and Cactus blockchains for the Hyperledger open-source project.
	- Leveraged Express web service and **REST API** to support all Iroha's API operations (20 commands and 15 queries operations); packaged and slimmed the Iroha Docker image by **85%**
	- Devised and deployed API request interfaces; handled response errors via various HTTP status codes
	- Utilized continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) and exceeded requirements in each stage, leading to the connector plugin being pushed to production

Selected Projects	- Built a mapping and routing web application (similar to Google Maps) based on Java to render a pixel-by-pixel map of the City of Berkeley
	- Converted OpenStreetMapâ€™s real-world data into a graph data structure
	- Implemented a routing function using a shortest-path algorithm (A* search algorithm) to provide users with the best route suggestions
